# Search-Based Planning Algorithms for Multi-Target Navigation

This project implements and compares search-based planning algorithms
(BFS, Dijkstra, A*) for multi-target navigation problems formulated
as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).

The project focuses on algorithmic performance, path optimality,
and visualization using matplotlib.
